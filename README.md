  "doc1" => ["sed", "perspiciatis", "unde"],
  "doc2" => ["vero", "eos", "accusamus"],
  "doc3" => ["vero", "eos", "accusamus", "iusto", "odio"]
}

Model.make_model('nanotubes', documents)
=> {
  "ipsum"            => ["doc0"],
  "sed perspiciatis" => ["doc1"],
  "vero"             => ["doc2", "doc3"]
